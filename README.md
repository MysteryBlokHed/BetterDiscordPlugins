# BetterDiscord Plugins

Plugins for [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp).

With Better Discord installed, go to User Settings > BetterDiscord > Plugins
and click 'Open Plugins Folder.' Then, drag and drop the plugin you want to
install. An option should appear to toggle it in the plugins menu.

Make sure that you drag and drop the files ending in `.js` and **not** `.ts`.
TypeScript files cannot be directly added to BetterDiscord.
