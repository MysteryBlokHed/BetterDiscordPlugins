# Activities

Start Discord Activities with friends.

## Use

This requires the [MsgHook Plugin] to work.
To use it, join a voice channel and type `.activity <game>` in any text channel.
You'll send a link that can be used to start an activity.
Make sure to click the blue part of the link and not the "Play" button.
